What is SingFlows ? 
===
_SingFlows_ is a research project in applied mathematics funded by the french agency [ANR](https://anr.fr/) under grant ANR-18-CE40-0027. Its goal is to develop mathematical and numerical tools for fluid flows with singularities. A detailed scientific description of the project can be found [here](/files/Scientific_description_Singflows.pdf)

Postdoctoral Offer - Mathematical Fluid Dynamics
===
_SingFlows_ offers a 1-year postdoctoral position, starting September 2021, with net salary around 2250 euros per month. This postdoc will be hosted by the [Institut de Mathématiques de Jussieu-Paris Rive Gauche](https://www.imj-prg.fr/), and supervised by project members based in Paris. We welcome applications from recent PhD graduates in PDE, preferably with a background in fluid mechanics.    

To apply, please send an [email](david.gerard-varet@imj-prg.fr) before **March 15th 2021** with 
1. cover letter
2. CV and list of publications
3. research description (maximum 2 pages) 

Support letters can be joined, or sent separately.

* _Summer school Kinetic and Fluid PDE's_ (canceled due to sanitary crisis)

<img style="float:left;margin-right:8px;" src="/images/summer_school_2020_v16.jpg" width="236" height="334"> 
The 20th IMJ-PRG summer school, entitled "Kinetic and Fluid PDE's", will take place in Paris from June 22nd to June 26th. It will be located on the Campus des Grands Moulins, Université de Paris.

The four lectures will be given by : Jacob Bedrossian (Univ. Maryland), Pierre-Emmanuel Jabin (Univ. Maryland), David Lannes (CNRS & Univ. Bordeaux) and Isabelle Tristani (CNRS & ENS).

Several research talks will complete the lectures. Speakers: 
Nathalie Ayi (Sorbonne Univ.), Sylvie Benzoni (IHP et Univ. Lyon 1), Laurent Desvillettes (Univ. Paris), Daniel Han-Kwan (CNRS & Ecole Polytechnique), Jose Rodrigo (Warwick), Robert Strain (UPenn), and Vlad Vicol (NYU).
